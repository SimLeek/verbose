An output library I made for some string functions I was doing a lot of the time for debugging and general output.

All commands are prefixed with 'VB'.

#Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
|VB_ID      | gives back the varible name as a string|
|VB_SHOW    | shows the name and value of a variable|
|VB_TITLE   | shows a title with the name inputted (Variable need not exist)|
|VB_ARRAY   | prints an 1d pointer array|
|VB_ARRAY2D | prints a 2d pointer array|
|VB_ARRAY3D |prints a 3d pointer array|
