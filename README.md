An output library I made for some string functions I was doing a lot of the time for debugging and general output.

All commands are prefixed with 'VB'.

#Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
|VB_ID      | gives back the text in the parenthesis as a string|
|VB_SHOW    | gives back the text in the parenthesis and what it evaluates to|
|VB_TITLE   | uses the characters in the parenthesis to create and eye-catching title|
|VB_ARRAY   | prints a 1d pointer array|
|VB_ARRAY2D | prints a 2d pointer array|
|VB_ARRAY3D |prints a 3d pointer array|
